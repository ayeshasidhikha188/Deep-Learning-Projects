# TensorFlow App 
This app allows users to configure a TensorFlow model with various parameters, providing insights into how each one influences the model's performance.

Below are the key parameters you can customize:

## Parameters
**1. Learning Rate:** Controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error during weight updates; affects convergence speed.

**2. Number of Hidden Layers:** Defines the complexity of the model; more layers can capture intricate patterns but may lead to overfitting.

**3. Activation Function:** Determines the output of each neuron in the hidden layers; affects how the model learns non-linear relationships.

**4. Batch Size:** Specifies the number of training samples to process before updating the model parameters; impacts training stability and memory usage.

**5. Regularization Rate:**  Helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty on the size of coefficients; improves generalization of the model.
